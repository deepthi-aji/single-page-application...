A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content as the user interacts with it. SPAs use AJAX requests to fetch data, eliminating the need to reload the page. This results in a smoother, faster user experience by minimizing server requests and page refreshes.
